# Color aware menu proof of concept

Menu that changes color based on the content behind it. Powered by [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/).

Demo available on:

**This is not production ready.** It is just something I hacked up together to see if it would work. This demo alone is 200kb of JavaScript to be downloaded and parsed.

## html-to-image

I added [html-to-image](https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image), which is much lighter, and got about the same performance. To try it add `#html-to-image` to the link above, or open it directly:
